# To-Do List App

This is a To-Do List App developed with Asp.NET Core MVC.

## Introduction

Right now, it is in its early stages and very simple in architecture. I developed it to practice fundamentals of Asp.NET and SQL Server.

## Functionality

Simple CRUD operations are used in developing this app:

- **Creating (Adding Tasks)**
- **Reading (Showing Tasks)**
- **Updating (Editing Tasks)**
- **Deleting (Removing Tasks)**

## Upcoming Features

Here are some exciting features we plan to add to our To-Do List application in the future:

- **Task prioritization**
- **Categories and tags for tasks**
- **Reminders and notifications**
- **Collaboration and sharing options**
